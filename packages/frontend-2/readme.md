# frontend-2 üè¨

The replacement for our old Vue 2 Vue CLI frontend SPA app. This one's built with Vue 3, Nuxt 3, Tailwind and is server side rendered. Should be a faster and nicer experience both for our devs and our users!

Look at the [nuxt 3 documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

And create an `.env` file from `.env.example`.

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:8081

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can serve the production build locally by running `yarn preview` afterwards.

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets) for more information.
